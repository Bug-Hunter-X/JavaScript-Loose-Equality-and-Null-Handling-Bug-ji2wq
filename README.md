# JavaScript Loose Equality and Null Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (`==`) and null value handling.  Improper handling of null values with loose equality can lead to unexpected behavior and logic errors.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains a function that demonstrates a potential issue when using loose equality.  Null values might not be handled correctly. 

## Solution

The solution is to explicitly check for null values using strict equality (`===`) or to implement explicit null checks. The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected function with the null value handling fixed.
